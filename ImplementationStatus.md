### Virtual patches

Built-in patches that are actually implemented as composition and work because the subpatches have been implemented:

- Toggle
- Pixels to Units


## In progress / Needs improvement

- Iterator
- TextImage
- Recursor
- Physics 
	- incorrect use of friction
	- doesn't take into account time between frames
- MouseInteraction
	- TODO: Detect correct targets using interaction connections
- Wave Generator (LFO)
	- TODO: implement PWM & random type

## Not implemented

- RoundedRectangle (virtual): On hold, requires custom CoreImage kernel
- Instructions (virtual): On hold, depends on rounded rectangle

And all others...
